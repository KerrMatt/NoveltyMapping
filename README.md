Widespread Ecological Novelty Across the Terrestrial Biosphere

This repository is the analytical code for the manuscript "Widespread Ecological Novelty Across the Terrestrial Biosphere" by Kerr et al (Under Review).
This code will be updated as new data becomes available, details will be given below. 
Queries should be sent to matthew.kerr@bio.au.dk.

The first script runs through the raw data to create the six different novelty metrics created for the paper. Each requires an externally available dataset - details are included in the code.
The second script runs through the novelty layers to run the analysis in the manuscript.
The third script creates figures displayed in the manuscript.

The novelty layers created in the first script and used in the second do not have to be manually created to run the analysis for checking. Layers are available openly at: https://zenodo.org/records/14677612
